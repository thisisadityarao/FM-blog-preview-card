## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Unlike the previous challenge (QR code component), I made use of **flexbox** for positioning and centering elements which made this challenge easier.

I learned how to use local fonts files with css. I also made use of **css custom properties** and [BEM](https://getbem.com/) naming convention.

I had to generate a modular type scale using one of the tools below for making font-size responsive or fluid. We make use of `clamp()` to set font-size.

### Continued development

I want to focus on improving my understanding of different font loading strategies, and creating and using a fluid type/space system for responsive design.

### Useful resources

- [utopia](https://utopia.fyi/type/calculator/) - This helped me create a fluid type scale. It's a powerful tool, which I need to explore more.
- [fluid-type-scale](https://www.fluid-type-scale.com/) - Another tool to create a fluid type scale.
